# Getting Started

You'll need a valid OpenAI subscription - save your API key under the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" # replace me!
```

## Option 1: Local Development

### ðŸ§¬ 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-chat.git
```

### ðŸ“¦ 2. Install Reflex

To get started with Reflex, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 12.22.0+ \(No JavaScript knowledge required!\)
- Pip dependencies: `reflex`, `openai`

Install `pip` dependencies with the provided `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸš€ 3. Run the application

Initialize and run the app:

```
reflex init
reflex run
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub Codespaces

This repository is configured to work with GitHub Codespaces, allowing you to develop in the cloud without setting up a local environment.

### 1. Open in Codespaces

Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and select "Open with Codespaces".

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Once your codespace is running, set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

For persistent storage of your API key in Codespaces, you can add it to your Codespaces secrets:
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Navigate to Settings > Codespaces
3. Add a new secret with name `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your API key as the value

### 3. Run the Application

The development container will automatically install dependencies. To run the app:

```bash
run-reflex-app
```

The app will be available on port 3000, which Codespaces will automatically forward for you.
